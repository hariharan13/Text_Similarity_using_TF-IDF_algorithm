# Text_Similarity_using_TF-IDF_algorithm
This program is  built for finding how close given the text documents are using TF-IDF algorithm 
This program needs nltk and scikit libraries 
Term frequency (TF): This technique tries to find the relative importance (or frequency) of a word in a given document
Inverse document frequency (IDF) : This technique makes sure that words that are frequently used (a, the, and so on) should be given lower weight when compared to the words that are rarely used.
Hence this test program uses only a few statements to find their closeness. In large scale,text doucements can be converted into sentences by following the steps provided in the program
